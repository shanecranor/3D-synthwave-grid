I had always wanted to be able to modify synth properties with equations similar to how you can control any parameter with any output in a traditional rack mount modular synth so I figured out the web audio API and built it myself.
		
		To implement equations, instead of writing my own function parser I take advantage of some of the quirks in vanilla javascript. When the user types a function into a text box my code calls the 'new Function' constructor in javascript to create a function that is called to determine the value for the parameter. A side effect of the user actually writing javascript functions is that they can use any global variable that is specified in the code. I use this to my advantage by making the current note that is being pressed a global variable 'note' to make an oscillator that is an octave higher you can simply change 'note' to 'note*2'.

    description: `Bubblz.space is peer to peer zoom competitor that I made in 24 hours in a team with two other ACM students (all collaborating remotely during the pandemic) for the HackUMBC hackathon. We used NodeJS and WebRTC (with the help of socket.io and peer.js) to build our application. We hosted our solution on Google Cloud. 

	Here is the pitch for our project: 
	Existing video call platforms have serious limitations. Most platforms only really let one person talk at a time, making it difficult to have natural conversations, where there may be many conversations going on in the same room at once. Furthermore, existing platforms are restrictive for remote learning, making it hard for professors and students to interact with each other in the same way they would in in-person classes.
	
	The advantage bubblz.space has over other video sharing software is the concept of “the bubble.” Bubbles are like public breakout rooms. When you go into a bubble you can only hear people who are talking in your bubble. Going in and out of bubbles is as easy as dragging your video feed to whichever bubble you want! This is nice because a professor or TA can see everyone in the class, even when in breakout rooms to more easily gauge how well the class is doing on the discussion or assignment. The site was live at bubblz.space in November 2020`,

    description: `This project was born out of the struggle of finding a parking spot at the airport (pre pandemic). I wondered if there was a simple solution to driving through endless rows full of parked cars. My first thought was to have a fleet of drones that fly above the lot every half hour or so and direct users to empty spots with laser pointers, or through a cellphone app. After thinking about it for a while I decided to ditch the moving parts and just mount the camera to light posts that are often found in parking lots as an easy way to get high elevation without needing to deal with drones. 
		
		A Raspberry Pi was used as the camera to collect images and I used Tensorflow to identify parked cars. Market research on existing solutions revealed that most solutions cost over $100 per parking space. My solution is over 100 times cheaper for 50 or more parking spaces with much lower installation costs. I took my project to the Regional Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science, got first award, and then went on to win first award at the state wide competition as well. I also presented at PRSEF, the Pittsburgh Regional Science & Engineering Fair, and won a sponsor award. I really enjoyed teaching myself how to set up tensorflow for use in a real world scenario as well as learning how to set up and use a Raspberry Pi.`,
